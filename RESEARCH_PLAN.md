# Agentic AI Research Plan

## 1. Research Objectives

### Why Study Agentic AI
Agentic AI represents the next evolution beyond chatbots — AI systems that independently plan, execute, and adapt multi-step workflows. The market is projected to grow from $7.8B (2025) to $52B by 2030 (45.8% CAGR). Understanding this landscape is critical for any startup positioning in AI.

### Key Questions
1. What business models work for agentic AI companies?
2. What creates defensibility — proprietary models, data moats, distribution, or vertical expertise?
3. Which categories are over-funded and which have whitespace?
4. What founder profiles and GTM strategies correlate with fastest growth?
5. How do companies navigate the "AI wrapper" problem — building real value vs. thin API layers?

### What a Startup Can Learn
- **Timing patterns**: When to enter, when categories consolidate
- **Capital efficiency**: Revenue per dollar raised by category
- **GTM playbooks**: PLG vs. enterprise sales vs. open-source by category
- **Pricing models**: Per-seat vs. usage-based vs. outcome-based economics
- **Technical moats**: What actually creates lasting competitive advantage

## 2. Definition Framework

### What Makes a Company "Worthy" to Research

A company qualifies if it scores 15+ on a 30-point scale across 6 criteria:

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | What 5/5 Looks Like |

| **Market Timing (MT)** | 1-5 | Riding a clear wave; category is <3 years old |
| **Technical Innovation (TI)** | 1-5 | Proprietary models, novel architecture, or breakthrough approach |
| **Growth Velocity (GV)** | 1-5 | >5x YoY ARR growth or fastest in category |
| **Business Model Innovation (BMI)** | 1-5 | New pricing/distribution model for the category |
| **Founder Story (FS)** | 1-5 | Deep domain expertise + technical skill + notable background |
| **Fundraising Strategy (FR)** | 1-5 | Strategic investors, capital-efficient, or record-breaking rounds |

### Inclusion Threshold
- Score 15+/30 → Full profile
- Score 10-14 → Brief profile
- Score <10 → Skip or monitor
