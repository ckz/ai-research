**Total Raised:** $620M+ confirmed, with $2B round in progress as of late 2025.

**Key Investors:** Nvidia, Bain Capital Ventures, DST Global, StepStone Group, Citi Ventures, HSBC Ventures, Xavier Niel, Felicis Ventures, Magnetar.

## Key Metrics
- **Revenue:** $50M (2025), up from $30M (2024) and $250K (2023)
- **Employees:** ~256 (2025)
- **Target Market:** Enterprises with 5,000+ developers (major banks, defense contractors)
- **Infrastructure:** Project Horizon -- 2-gigawatt AI campus in Pecos County, Texas (started October 2025), 40,000+ NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 GPUs via CoreWeave partnership
- **Go-to-Market:** Custom model deployment within client infrastructure, not generic API access

## Products & Features
- **Custom Foundation Models:** For each enterprise customer, Poolside spins up dedicated training environments within the client's infrastructure, ingests their existing codebase and development history, and fine-tunes models specifically for that organization.
- **Code Execution Environment:** Claims to have the world's largest code execution environment for training AI coding agents.
- **AWS First-Party Offering:** Available as a first-party service on AWS for broader developer access.
- **Enterprise Security:** Models run within client infrastructure, addressing data privacy concerns for regulated industries.
- **Project Horizon Data Center:** 2GW AI campus for massive-scale training and inference.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: GitHub Copilot (20M users, 90% Fortune 100), Augment Code, Cursor, Cognition (Devin), Replit ($3B valuation), Tabnine, Amazon CodeWhisperer.

Poolside differentiates through custom enterprise model training -- deploying dedicated, fine-tuned models within each client's infrastructure rather than offering a generic API. This appeals to highly regulated industries (banking, defense) that cannot send code to external APIs.

## Strategic Notes
- Valuation has quadrupled from $3B to $12B in roughly one year, driven by Nvidia's massive backing.
- The custom model deployment approach is capital-intensive but creates deep enterprise lock-in.
- Project Horizon data center signals ambitions far beyond a typical SaaS startup -- Poolside is building infrastructure at hyperscaler scale.
- $50M revenue on a $12B valuation implies ~240x revenue multiple -- extremely aggressive, reflecting investor belief in the TAM for enterprise AI coding.
- Acquisition of Fern Labs (November 2025) suggests expansion of product capabilities.
- Key risk: GitHub Copilot's distribution dominance and the challenge of scaling custom deployments profitably.
- The AI coding tools market is projected to reach $27B by 2032 (Polaris Market Research).

## Status
Active -- Rapidly scaling Series C company with the highest valuation among pure-play AI coding startups, backed by Nvidia's strategic investment and building massive-scale infrastructure.
