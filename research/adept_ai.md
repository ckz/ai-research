## Key Metrics
- **Total funding:** $415M raised before the Amazon deal
- **Valuation:** $1B+ (post-Series B)
- **Amazon deal (June 2024):** Strategic talent hire + non-exclusive technology license. Investors made whole from Amazon funds.
- **Post-deal team:** Smaller team under new CEO Zach Brock, focused on enterprise solutions
- **Amazon AGI SF Lab:** New lab led by David Luan (seeded by former Adept employees), focused on digital and physical world AI agents

## Products & Features
- **ACT-1 (Action Transformer)** -- Foundation model trained to use software tools via natural language commands
- **Enterprise automation** -- Document extraction, email processing, application navigation, form filling, data entry
- **Natural language software control** -- Users describe tasks in plain language; the AI agent executes multi-step workflows across applications
- **Post-Amazon pivot:** The remaining company now leverages a mix of proprietary Adept tech + third-party AI models to serve enterprise clients
- **Key differentiator (original):** Unlike chatbots that generate text, Adept built AI that could *act* -- clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating UIs

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Anthropic (Claude Computer Use), OpenAI (Operator), Microsoft (Copilot Actions), Salesforce (AgentForce), UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and emerging agentic AI startups.

Adept was a pioneer in the "AI agent" category but lost its founding team and momentum to the Amazon deal. The agentic AI space has since exploded with well-funded competitors.

## Strategic Notes
- The Amazon deal is a cautionary tale for the AI startup ecosystem: Adept raised $415M, achieved $1B+ valuation, but ultimately could not sustain the capital intensity of training foundation models independently. The "acqui-hire" pattern (Amazon/Adept, Microsoft/Inflection) has drawn FTC scrutiny as potential disguised acquisitions.
- Ashish Vaswani and Niki Parmar (Transformer paper co-authors) as co-founders gave Adept extraordinary research credibility but also highlighted the challenge: world-class researchers may prefer the resources of Big Tech.
- The remaining Adept (under Zach Brock) is essentially a different company -- smaller, less capitalized, and competing in a now-crowded market.
- Amazon's AGI SF Lab (December 2024), led by David Luan, is the real successor to Adept's mission -- but inside Amazon, not as an independent startup.
- Key insight for startups: Adept's story illustrates the "foundation model trap" -- building your own foundation model requires billions in compute. Startups that build application-layer agents on top of existing models (Claude, GPT) may have more sustainable economics.
- The global agentic AI market is projected to grow from $7.3B (2025) to $41.3B (2030) at 41% CAGR.

## Status
Quasi-Acquired -- Co-founders and key talent hired by Amazon (June 2024). Technology licensed to Amazon on a non-exclusive basis. Remaining company operates independently under new CEO Zach Brock with a smaller team focused on enterprise AI solutions.
