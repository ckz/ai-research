- **Pricing:** Usage-based at $0.05/minute platform fee + pass-through third-party provider costs
- **SDKs:** Web, iOS, Android/Flutter

## Products & Features
- **Voice Agent API/SDK:** Core platform for building AI-powered voice agents with low-latency, real-time conversation capabilities.
- **Modular Architecture:** Developers can use default providers or "bring your own" for each component:
  - **Transcription:** Deepgram, AssemblyAI, etc.
  - **Language Model:** OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, etc.
  - **Text-to-Speech:** ElevenLabs, PlayHT, etc.
- **Function Calling:** Voice agents can trigger actions and pull information from external knowledge bases and systems.
- **Multi-Platform SDKs:** Web, iOS, Android/Flutter for cross-platform deployment.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Multi-turn dialogue, contextual awareness, customizable personality.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Handles millions of concurrent calls with sub-second latency.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Retell AI, Bland AI, Vocode, LiveKit, Sinch, Twilio (traditional), Inflection, Mistral AI (broadly).

Vapi has 840 active competitors, including 130 funded. Vapi differentiates as the developer-first voice AI platform -- abstracting away the complexity of orchestrating transcription, LLM, and TTS into a single API call, analogous to how Twilio simplified telephony.

## Strategic Notes
- The "Twilio for AI agents" positioning is compelling -- Twilio built a $65B+ peak market cap by simplifying communications APIs; Vapi is applying the same playbook to voice AI.
- 100K+ developers is strong community traction for a Series A company, suggesting viral developer adoption.
- Origin story (pivoting from AI therapist to platform) demonstrates the founders' ability to recognize a larger platform opportunity.
- $0.05/minute platform fee with pass-through costs is a thin-margin model at scale, but volume (millions of calls/month) creates meaningful revenue.
- Y Combinator pedigree (W21 batch) and Bessemer backing provide strong institutional support.
- Both founders are University of Waterloo engineers -- same school that produced many top tech founders in Canada.
- The voice AI agent market is nascent but growing rapidly as enterprises deploy AI for customer service, sales, and appointment scheduling.
- At $130M valuation on ~$8M revenue, the ~16x revenue multiple is relatively modest for an AI startup, suggesting potential for significant upside.
- Key risk: Voice AI platforms face competition from both startups (Retell, Bland) and large incumbents (Twilio adding AI capabilities, cloud providers building voice AI services).

## Status
Active -- Early-stage Series A company with strong developer traction (100K+ developers), positioned as the leading developer platform for voice AI agents with usage-based infrastructure pricing.
