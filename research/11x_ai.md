## Founders & Leadership
- **Hasan Sukkar** -- Founder & former CEO (stepped down May 2025, now non-executive chairman). Syrian-born, immigrated to UK at 17 as a refugee. University of Exeter engineering graduate. Worked at McKinsey London for ~2 years before founding 11x, inspired by the repetitive work he wished AI could handle.

Other investors include 20VC, 20SALES, Lux Capital, SV Angel, Capital 49, Avra, and Harry Stebbings.

## Key Metrics
- **ARR:** Approaching $10M at Series B; reportedly grew to ~$25M ARR (150% increase in 3 months per 20VC's Harry Stebbings)
- **Revenue Multiple:** ~35x ARR at Series B valuation
- **Employees:** ~27-48 (various reports, rapid growth phase)
- **Pricing:** ~$50K-$60K/year per agent (annual commitment, ~$5K/month)
- **Languages Supported:** 28+ (Jordan phone agent)

## Products & Features
- **Alice (AI SDR)** -- Autonomous AI Sales Development Representative that handles full outbound pipeline: lead sourcing, research, email personalization, and outreach at 11x the scale of a human SDR. Rebuilt from scratch with multi-agent architecture in 2024 for autonomous lead sourcing, research, and personalization.
- **Jordan (AI Phone Agent)** -- 24/7 AI phone representative capable of natural conversations up to 30 minutes in 28 languages. Handles both inbound and outbound calls. Built on technology from Opkit acquisition.
- **Platform Vision** -- Expanding from 2 workers to 20+ digital workers across revenue operations, sales enablement, customer success, solution engineering, and marketing.
- **Key Differentiator:** Named "digital workers" rather than "tools" -- designed to replace entire roles rather than augment existing ones.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Regie.ai, AiSDR, Artisan, Salesforce Agentforce, Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo.io, Clay (for enrichment)

11x differentiates through the "digital worker" framing (role replacement vs. tool augmentation), multi-agent architecture, and backing from Benchmark and a16z.

## Strategic Notes
- The CEO transition (Sukkar stepping down, Jain taking over) in May 2025 signals a shift from founder-led vision to execution-focused leadership -- common when scaling from product to platform.
- The London-to-SF relocation was reportedly driven by customer proximity and VC requirements -- a common pattern for European AI startups.
- A March 2025 TechCrunch article alleged 11x was "claiming customers it doesn't have," which is a significant reputational risk and warrants due diligence.
- The ~$50-60K/year price point positions 11x as a replacement for a junior SDR salary (~$50-70K base), making the ROI argument straightforward for enterprises.
- The 150% ARR growth in 3 months (per Harry Stebbings) is impressive but should be validated -- early-stage ARR can be lumpy with large enterprise deals.
- The platform expansion to 20+ digital workers is ambitious and necessary for the $350M valuation to be justified, but execution risk is high.
- Mixed user reviews (high satisfaction on some platforms, critical long-form posts on others) suggest product quality may be inconsistent.

## Status
Active -- Fast-growing AI digital worker platform with strong VC backing (Benchmark + a16z). Recent CEO change and platform expansion signal a pivotal transition phase. Customer claim controversy and mixed reviews are risks to monitor.
