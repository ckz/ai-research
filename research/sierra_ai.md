## Competitive Position
Competing with: Zendesk AI, Salesforce Agentforce, Intercom Fin, Ada, Forethought, Google CCAI, Amazon Connect

Sierra's moat is the founder pedigree (Taylor's Salesforce/OpenAI connections), outcomes-based pricing that aligns incentives, and rapid enterprise adoption across both tech-forward and traditional industries.

## Strategic Notes
- Bret Taylor's dual role as Sierra CEO and OpenAI board chairman creates extraordinary strategic positioning -- deep insight into frontier model capabilities and roadmap.
- The outcomes-based pricing model is a bold bet that differentiates from SaaS subscription competitors. It only works if agents reliably complete tasks -- a strong signal of product confidence.
- $100M ARR in 21 months with an outcomes-based model is arguably more impressive than subscription-based ARR because it means customers are actually getting measurable value.
- Customer list spanning Rivian, Discord, Ramp, and SoFi (tech) alongside ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM (traditional) proves the platform works across industries.
- The Receptive AI acquisition for voice capabilities signals expansion from text-based agents to omni-channel, which is the clear direction for enterprise customer experience.
- Partnership with Stellarus to deploy AI agents for health plans (Blue Shield of California, Jan 2026) shows healthcare vertical expansion.

## Status
Active -- One of the fastest-growing enterprise AI companies in history. $10B valuation and $100M ARR in under two years, backed by elite founder team and strategic positioning at the intersection of enterprise AI and customer experience.
