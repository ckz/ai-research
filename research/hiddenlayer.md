## Competitive Position
Competing with: Robust Intelligence (acquired by Cisco), Protect AI, CalypsoAI, Adversa AI, Lakera, general cybersecurity vendors expanding into AI.

**Key differentiator:** First-mover in dedicated AI model security with strategic backing from Microsoft, IBM, and defense/intelligence community. The $151B SHIELD contract and Microsoft AI Studio integration provide unmatched government and enterprise credibility. Air-gapped deployment capability is critical for defense and intelligence customers.

## Strategic Notes
- The $151B SHIELD IDIQ contract (December 2025) is transformational — it positions HiddenLayer as a core security vendor for the Department of Defense's Golden Dome initiative and establishes credibility for the entire AI security category.
- Microsoft selecting HiddenLayer as the sole scanning tool in AI Studio is an enormous endorsement. Combined with M12 investment and Pegasus Program participation, the Microsoft relationship is a major competitive moat.
- Strategic investors (Microsoft, IBM, Booz Allen, Capital One) are also potential customers, creating built-in distribution.
- The Cyera partnership (April 2025) for end-to-end AI lifecycle protection signals maturation from model security into broader AI data security.
- With only $56M raised and already securing massive government contracts, the company appears positioned for a significant Series B.
- The 2026 AI Threat Landscape Report positions HiddenLayer as a thought leader: "AI systems are no longer just generating outputs — they are taking action."
- Risk: AI security is still an emerging category. If enterprises decide to handle AI security with existing cybersecurity tools rather than specialized platforms, the market could be smaller than projected.

## Status
Active — Leading AI security company with strong government and enterprise momentum. Secured position on $151B defense contract and exclusive Microsoft AI Studio integration. Positioned for significant growth as AI security becomes a mandatory enterprise requirement.
