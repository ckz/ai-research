## Funding History
| Round | Date | Amount | Valuation | Lead Investor |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Series A | 2023 | $25M | Undisclosed | Sutter Hill Ventures |
| Series B | April 2024 | $227M | $977M post-money | Sutter Hill Ventures, Index Ventures |

**Total Raised:** ~$270M (as of late 2025)

**Key Investors:** Sutter Hill Ventures, Index Ventures, Innovation Endeavors (Eric Schmidt), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Meritech Capital, Evolution Equity Partners.

## Key Metrics
- **Employees:** 193 (as of January 2026)
- **Context Engine:** Processes 400,000+ files per codebase
- **SWE-bench:** Achieved highest score on SWE-bench verified (late 2025)
- **Win Rate:** 70% win rate over GitHub Copilot in head-to-head evaluations
- **Pricing:** $60/user/month
- **Multi-file Refactoring Accuracy:** 89% verified accuracy
- **Certification:** ISO/IEC 42001 certified (enterprise AI management)

## Products & Features
- **Context Engine:** Core differentiator -- indexes and understands entire codebases (400K+ files), providing deep context for AI suggestions across large enterprise repositories.
- **AI Coding Agent:** Agentic coding assistant that can autonomously plan, execute, and verify multi-step code changes.
- **Multi-file Refactoring:** Handles complex refactoring tasks across multiple files with 89% verified accuracy.
- **IDE Integration:** Works within existing developer workflows (VS Code, JetBrains).
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Launched February 2026, enabling AI coding agents to connect with external tools and data sources.
- **Enterprise Security:** ISO/IEC 42001 certified, designed for enterprise compliance requirements.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: GitHub Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor, Tabnine, Cognition (Devin), Codeium/Windsurf, Codegen, Amazon CodeWhisperer.

Augment ranks 3rd among 144 active competitors in the AI coding assistant space. Its primary differentiation is deep codebase context understanding for large enterprise codebases, compared to competitors that focus on single-file or limited-context completion.

## Strategic Notes
- Near-unicorn status at $977M valuation -- likely to cross $1B in next funding round.
- Strong enterprise positioning with ISO certification and large-codebase focus differentiates from developer-focused tools like Cursor.
- Eric Schmidt backing signals credibility with enterprise buyers.
- The Context Engine processing 400K+ files is a meaningful moat -- most competitors struggle with whole-codebase understanding.
- $60/user/month pricing positions above GitHub Copilot ($19/month individual) but below enterprise custom pricing from competitors like Cognition.
- Key risk: GitHub Copilot's distribution advantage through GitHub/Microsoft ecosystem.

## Status
Active -- Series B company approaching unicorn status, rapidly growing in the enterprise AI coding assistant market with strong investor backing and differentiated deep-context technology.
