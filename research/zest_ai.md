## Products & Features
- **AI Underwriting:** Machine learning models that analyze far more data points than traditional credit scores to identify creditworthy borrowers who are overlooked by legacy methods. Custom and scalable models available.
- **LuLu (Lending Intelligence Platform):** Generative AI-powered platform for lending intelligence — the next evolution beyond traditional model management.
- **Zest Model Management System (ZMMS):** Enables lenders to build, deploy, monitor, and explain ML credit models with full regulatory compliance.
- **Zest Protect:** AI-powered fraud detection for lending operations.
- **Explainability:** Models come with built-in explainability for regulatory compliance (fair lending, adverse action notices).
- **Regulatory compliance:** Designed to meet ECOA, FCRA, and other lending regulations. Models are auditable and explainable.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: FICO, Upstart, Scienaptic AI, Pagaya, traditional credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion), in-house credit model teams at large banks.

**Key differentiator:** Depth of lending-specific AI expertise (650+ proprietary credit models, 50+ patents, 15+ years in the space). Unlike general-purpose AI platforms, Zest AI is purpose-built for regulated lending with full explainability and compliance. The customer-led funding round (customers literally investing in the company) is a powerful signal of product value.

## Strategic Notes
- The customer-led investment round (November 2025) is remarkable: when your customers invest in your company, it is the strongest possible product-market fit signal. Five major lenders putting their own capital in demonstrates deep trust.
- The $17 trillion US consumer credit market is Zest AI's addressable market — even modest penetration represents massive revenue potential.
- 300 lenders served with 650+ proprietary models creates a data and expertise flywheel that is very difficult for competitors to replicate.
- SchoolsFirst FCU CEO said their "instant approval rate has more than doubled" — this kind of customer testimony drives enterprise sales.
- Named to Forbes Fintech 50 (2024) and CNBC World's Top FinTech Companies (2025, Enterprise FinTech category).
- LuLu (Gen AI lending intelligence) represents the next phase: moving beyond underwriting into comprehensive lending intelligence.
- Risk: Regulatory environment for AI in lending is evolving. While Zest AI's explainability focus is an advantage, new regulations could create compliance overhead. Competition from well-funded Upstart and traditional FICO modernization efforts.
- The company has been operating for 15+ years — longer than most AI companies. This longevity demonstrates sustainability but also means growth has been methodical rather than explosive.

## Status
Active — Established AI lending technology leader with 15+ years of operation, ~300 lender customers, and strong regulatory compliance positioning. Recent customer-led investment round signals deep product-market fit. Expanding into generative AI with LuLu platform.
