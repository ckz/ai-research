## Competitive Position
Competing with: Suki AI, Nuance (Microsoft), NVoq, Abridge, Ambience Healthcare, Aptible

Corti differentiates as an AI infrastructure layer (APIs and platform) rather than a point solution. Its European-first sovereign cloud positioning and EU AI Act compliance readiness give it a structural advantage in European markets. The NHS partnership and 250K daily interactions demonstrate scale.

## Strategic Notes
- European sovereign AI infrastructure is a massive differentiator — EU AI Act enforcement in 2026 creates regulatory tailwinds
- "Down the AI stack" positioning (infrastructure vs. application) creates platform leverage
- NHS partnership validates clinical credibility at national health system scale
- Largest Series B for a Danish HealthTech company ever ($60M)
- CEO has stated company will go public "at some point" but not in 2026 — private markets still attractive for fundraising
- Swiss compliance first, then expanding to France, Germany, Middle East — smart regulatory sequencing
- Risk: $13.3M revenue against $260M valuation requires significant acceleration; US market expansion is critical but competitive

## Status
Active — Europe's leading healthcare AI infrastructure company with 250K+ daily patient interactions. Pioneering sovereign healthcare AI in preparation for EU AI Act (2026). IPO considered but not imminent.
