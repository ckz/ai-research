## Strategic Notes
- Valuation tripled from $1.5B to $4.5B in just six months (June 2025 to January 2026) -- one of the fastest valuation jumps in enterprise AI.
- Founded only in August 2023 and already at $4.5B -- extraordinary velocity for a startup less than 2.5 years old.
- The customer support AI market is among the most contested in enterprise AI, but Decagon's rapid customer acquisition suggests strong product-market fit.
- Deutsche Telekom pilot (November 2025) with strategic investment from T.Capital signals expansion into European telco market.
- Series D round drew 5x more investor demand than capacity, indicating extreme investor enthusiasm.
- Key risk: Incumbent platforms (Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud, Intercom) are rapidly adding AI capabilities and have existing distribution.
- The $35M ARR on a $4.5B valuation implies ~129x revenue multiple -- highly premium pricing reflecting growth trajectory.

## Status
Active -- One of the fastest-growing enterprise AI startups in history, going from founding to $4.5B valuation in under 2.5 years, with rapid enterprise customer acquisition across multiple industries.
