## Competitive Position
Competing with: Jasper, Copy.ai, Grammarly Business, UnifyApps, Uniphore, Aisera, Microsoft Copilot

Writer differentiates through its full-stack approach (proprietary models, not API wrappers), enterprise-grade compliance features, and industry-specific model customization. The pivot from content generation to agentic workflows positions it for the $93B business process automation market.

## Strategic Notes
- Synthetic data training reduced model costs to $700K vs $100M+ for competitors — enables rapid vertical expansion
- 200%+ net revenue retention signals strong product-market fit and expansion within accounts
- Strategic corporate venture investors (Salesforce, Citi, IBM, Workday) double as distribution channels
- Healthcare AI market alone projected at $45B by 2026 — PalmyraMed is the wedge
- Immigration founder story (Lebanon + Syria) resonates in enterprise sales and brand building
- Risk: Enterprise AI platform market increasingly crowded; Microsoft Copilot is the elephant in the room

## Status
Active — Scaling rapidly with 200%+ NRR and expanding from content AI into full agentic enterprise workflows. Recent Writer Agent launch (November 2025) marks transition from writing tool to enterprise automation platform.
