Ema differentiates through its "Universal AI Employee" positioning — rather than offering point solutions, it provides a platform for deploying AI agents across any enterprise function. The EmaFusion multi-model approach avoids lock-in to any single LLM provider.

## Strategic Notes
- KPMG strategic investment (October 2024) is a powerful signal — Big Four firm betting on Ema for audit, tax, and advisory AI transformation
- Microsoft Pegasus Program membership provides enterprise distribution and credibility
- Founder pedigree (Coinbase CPO + Google VP + Okta VP Engineering) opens doors at enterprise scale
- Multi-model approach (EmaFusion) is strategically sound — avoids dependency on any single model provider
- On-premises deployment option critical for regulated industry adoption
- Risk: "Universal AI Employee" is a broad positioning — may face challenges against vertical-specific competitors

## Status
Active — Rapidly scaling post-stealth (March 2024) with tripled customer base and KPMG strategic partnership. Positioned as a leading agentic AI platform for enterprise automation across all functions and industries.
