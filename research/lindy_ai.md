## Products & Features
- **Agent Builder** -- No-code platform for creating AI agents through natural language. Users describe what they want the agent to do, and Lindy builds the workflow.
- **Lindy Build** -- Application development tool with automated testing for building AI-powered apps.
- **Computer Use** -- Web automation capability that goes beyond traditional API limitations, allowing agents to interact with any web application visually.
- **5,000+ Integrations** -- Gmail, Zoom, Twilio, Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, and thousands more.
- **Multi-Model Support** -- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default), GPT-5, Gemini Flash 2.0, Claude Haiku 3.5, and others. Model selection affects performance and credit consumption.
- **Use Cases:** Sales automation, customer support, recruiting, email management, meeting scheduling, CRM data entry, lead qualification, content moderation, and research.
- **Key Differentiator:** Unlike Zapier's if-then rules, Lindy's agents use LLMs to understand context, make decisions, and adapt to changing situations autonomously.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Zapier, Make.com, n8n, Microsoft Power Automate, CrewAI, LangChain, Relevance AI, Sanalabs, Convergence, Questflow

Lindy differentiates through no-code accessibility (targeting non-technical users), breadth of integrations, and positioning as an "AI employee" rather than a workflow automation tool.

## Strategic Notes
- The pivot from Teamflow (virtual office) to Lindy (AI agents) is a textbook example of a founder recognizing a market shift and executing quickly. Crivello fired 2/3 of his team and rebuilt.
- The "Zapier of AI" positioning is smart -- it anchors to something enterprises already understand while signaling the next-generation capability.
- $5.1M revenue with a ~37-person team suggests lean operations, but the 5.5x growth rate indicates strong momentum.
- 70,000 waitlist signups from a single tweet demonstrates Crivello's strength as a product marketer and Twitter influencer (years of 20 tweets/day built the audience).
- The credit-based pricing model (free tier at 400 credits/month, Pro at $49.99/month) is accessible but may face challenges converting free users to paid.
- Computer Use capability (visual web automation) is a meaningful differentiator that extends Lindy beyond API-connected tools.
- The company is likely to raise additional funding soon -- Crunchbase estimates 80% probability of a new round within 6 months.

## Status
Active -- Growing AI agent platform with strong founder-market fit and expanding product surface. Still early-stage relative to competitors but differentiated through no-code accessibility and breadth of integrations. Likely to raise significant new funding in 2026.
