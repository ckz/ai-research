## Key Metrics
- **Units shipped:** 100,000+ R1 devices (as of September 2025)
- **Device price:** $199 (no subscription)
- **Pre-sale velocity:** Sold out first three batches of 10,000 units within days at CES 2024
- **Team size:** Undisclosed but estimated 50-100 employees
- **Software updates:** 100+ updates shipped since launch; major rabbitOS 2.0 overhaul (September 2025)

## Products & Features
- **Rabbit R1** -- Pocket-sized AI companion device with scroll wheel, camera, screen, and speaker. Designed by Teenage Engineering.
- **rabbitOS** -- Natural language operating system built on the Large Action Model (LAM). Not an app store -- the AI interacts with apps on your behalf.
- **Large Action Model (LAM)** -- Trained on videos of humans interacting with UIs over 3 years. Understands user interfaces and performs actions (clicking, filling forms, navigating) rather than just generating text.
- **Teach Mode (Nov 2024)** -- Users can create custom agents by demonstrating tasks on the device.
- **R1 Creations / Vibe Coding (Sep 2025)** -- Users can "vibe code" custom software and games for the R1 through conversation.
- **Rabbit Intern (Jun 2025)** -- Second product launch; agent-based assistant.
- **Next-gen device (2026)** -- "Three-in-one" cyberdeck vibe coding device in development with Teenage Engineering. Partially mechanical keyboard, bigger screen, internet-connected.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Humane Ai Pin, smartphones (the real competitor), OpenAI (rumored hardware plans), and emerging AI companion devices.

The R1 faces the fundamental question: "Why does this need to be a separate device?" The Humane Ai Pin struggled with the same challenge and largely failed. Rabbit's approach has been to lean into the hardware's unique form factor and "vibe coding" capabilities rather than trying to replace smartphones.

## Strategic Notes
- The R1 launch was widely criticized. Marques Brownlee called it "barely reviewable." The device's functions were easily replicated on smartphones, and early reviews were devastating.
- Coffeezilla controversy (May 2024): Investigation revealed the company's pre-pivot NFT project (GAMA) under the Cyber Manufacturing Co. name, raising questions about founder credibility. Lyu dismissed GAMA as a "fun little project."
- Despite the rocky launch, Rabbit shipped 100K units and executed a major software overhaul (rabbitOS 2.0). Jesse Lyu's willingness to publicly acknowledge failures and pivot is notable.
- The "vibe coding cyberdeck" pivot for the next-gen device is an interesting strategic shift -- targeting the developer/maker community rather than general consumers.
- Key insight for startups: Rabbit illustrates both the risk and potential of AI hardware. The initial R1 failed to answer "why not just use a phone?" The next-gen device may succeed by targeting a specific use case (vibe coding) where a dedicated device genuinely adds value.
- AI hardware is increasingly crowded. OpenAI is reportedly entering the hardware market in 2026, which would dramatically raise competitive intensity.

## Status
Active - R1 device continues to receive software updates. Next-generation "cyberdeck" vibe coding device in development for 2026 launch. Company is in a self-described "redemption arc."
