## Products & Features
- **LangChain (1.0)** -- Core orchestration framework for building LLM applications. Pre-built architectures for common agent patterns, model integrations, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **LangGraph (1.0)** -- Low-level agent orchestration framework with fine-grained control over every step. Supports memory, human-in-the-loop, streaming, and complex multi-agent workflows. This is the primary agent-building framework.
- **LangSmith** -- Commercial observability and evaluation platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications in production.
- **LangGraph Platform (Deployment)** -- One-click deployment infrastructure for shipping agents, built for long-running agentic tasks.
- **Agent Builder** (private preview) -- No-code text-to-agent experience for rapid prototyping.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: OpenAI Agents SDK, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, AWS Bedrock Agents, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, Langdock, Weights & Biases, Arize, FlowiseAI

LangChain's moat is its massive open-source community (largest in the LLM tooling space), breadth of integrations (1000+ providers), and the LangSmith observability layer that creates vendor stickiness in production deployments.

## Strategic Notes
- The pivot from "LangChain as a monolithic framework" to "LangGraph for agents + LangSmith for observability" was a critical strategic move that addressed developer criticism about LangChain's complexity.
- The 1.0 releases of both LangChain and LangGraph (Oct 2025) signal maturity and enterprise readiness, with a commitment to no breaking changes until 2.0.
- LangChain faces existential pressure from model providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) building their own agent SDKs. The counter-strategy is model-agnosticism and superior observability.
- The $1.25B unicorn valuation on ~$260M raised positions LangChain as the infrastructure layer for the agentic era, but monetization must scale significantly to justify the valuation.
- Key strategic partnerships with Workday, ServiceNow, Datadog, and Databricks as both investors and customers create strong enterprise distribution channels.

## Status
Active -- Unicorn-status AI infrastructure company. The most widely adopted open-source LLM framework, now pivoting toward agentic AI with LangGraph as the primary growth vector.
