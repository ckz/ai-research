Notable: D.R. Horton (largest US homebuilder) participated in Series A as both investor and enterprise customer. Engineering Capital followed on from seed.

## Key Metrics
- **Loans powered:** On track to power 200,000+ loans annually (~4% of projected $1.46T US mortgage originations in 2026)
- **Employees:** ~40 (as of November 2025)
- **Enterprise clients:** NEXA Lending, First Colony Mortgage, Mortgage Solutions, D.R. Horton
- **Market size:** $2T+ US mortgage market; $1.46T in originations projected for 2026 (MBA)
- **Cost savings:** Freddie Mac research shows AI automation can reduce origination costs by $1,500/loan

## Products & Features
- **Tidalwave SOLO** -- Agentic AI mortgage POS+ platform; specialized autonomous agents handle end-to-end tasks (verification, underwriting, compliance)
- **Direct GSE integrations** -- Instant underwriting verifications via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
- **Real-time verification stack** -- Integrations with Plaid, Argyle, and Truv for income, employment, and asset verification
- **Automation of 43-day close cycle** -- Hundreds of manual data-entry tasks replaced by autonomous agents
- **Key differentiator:** Agentic architecture (not copilot) -- agents operate with minimal human oversight across disconnected mortgage systems

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Blend, Encompass (ICE Mortgage Technology), Mortgage Cadence, Roostify, BeSmartee, Maxwell, and legacy LOS/POS platforms.

Tidalwave differentiates with an "agentic-first" approach where AI agents autonomously execute mortgage workflows, versus competitors who layer AI assistance on top of existing manual processes.

## Strategic Notes
- Diane Yu's track record (FreeWheel exit to Comcast) lends significant founder credibility.
- D.R. Horton's dual role as investor + customer is a strong signal of product-market fit in the homebuilder channel.
- The mortgage industry is notoriously slow to adopt technology but under extreme cost pressure ($7,000-$12,000 per loan origination). AI automation targeting this pain point has large TAM potential.
- Agentic AI in mortgage is early-stage with regulatory complexity (RESPA, TILA, fair lending). First-mover advantage in compliance-aware AI could create a significant moat.
- Key insight for startups: Tidalwave's strategy of integrating directly with GSEs (Fannie/Freddie) creates infrastructure-level lock-in that is difficult for competitors to replicate.

## Status
Active - Growing rapidly post-Series A. Expanding enterprise partnerships and targeting 4% of US mortgage origination market by 2026.
