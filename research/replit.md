- **Model-Agnostic AI** -- Integrates Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Google Gemini.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Cursor (Anysphere, $29.3B), Cognition/Devin, Lovable ($6.6B), GitHub Copilot, Bolt.new, v0 (Vercel), Google IDX

Replit differentiates through its integrated full-stack platform (agent + IDE + database + auth + hosting in one), browser/mobile-first approach, and strategic pivot to target non-programmers ("ordinary people who can't write code").

## Strategic Notes
- Replit's pivot from "professional developer tool" to "app creation for everyone" after a 50% staff layoff in 2024 is a dramatic but potentially transformative strategic bet. The subsequent revenue explosion validates the move.
- The jump from ~$2.8M to $240M revenue in roughly one year is one of the most dramatic growth curves in software history, driven almost entirely by the Replit Agent launch.
- Targeting $1B revenue in 2026 would represent ~4x growth -- ambitious but consistent with the trajectory.
- Fluctuating gross margins (36% to -14%) due to LLM inference costs are the key risk factor. Unit economics at scale remain unproven.
- The model-agnostic approach (Claude + GPT-4o + Gemini) is smart for avoiding dependency but adds complexity and cost.
- 750K+ businesses using Replit creates massive distribution for upselling agent capabilities.
- Enterprise customers (Zillow, Coinbase, Duolingo, HubSpot, Mercedes-Benz) signal growing upmarket traction.

## Status
Active -- One of the fastest-growing companies in all of tech, with a dramatic AI-driven transformation from a coding education tool to a $9B AI app creation platform. Gross margin challenges and competition from well-funded rivals are key risks.
