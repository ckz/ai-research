## Founder Background

### Naveen Rao (CEO)
- Former head of AI at Databricks
- Founded MosaicML (sold to Databricks for $1.3B in 2023)
- Founded Nervana Systems (sold to Intel for $350M in 2016)
- Personally invested $10M in Unconventional AI
- Serial entrepreneur with proven exits

### Other Founders
- **Michael Carbin**: Co-founder
- **Sara Achour**: Co-founder
- **MeeLan Lee**: Co-founder

## Mission: Energy-Efficient AI

### The Problem
- AI is intrinsically linked to hardware
- Hardware is intrinsically linked to power
- Current AI systems are power-hungry
- Energy production can't scale fast enough for AI demands

### The Solution
Building computers "as efficient as biology":
- Human brain: ~20 watts for extraordinary computation
- Current AI systems: Thousands of watts
- Goal: Biological-level efficiency

## Technical Approach

### Not Pure Neuromorphic
- Not solely focused on neuromorphic computing
- "Why does it have to work like the brain?"
- Borrowing useful concepts from brain

### Hardware Strategy
- Exploring multiple approaches for ML accelerator efficiency
- Fabricated in silicon
- Likely analog chip (vs digital)

### Differentiation from Competitors
- General learning system approach
- Not constrained by brain-like operation requirement
- Novel architectural exploration

## Competitive Position
Competing with:
- Intel (Loihi neuromorphic chips)
- IBM (TrueNorth)
- BrainChip
- Groq
- Cerebras
- Traditional GPU makers (Nvidia, AMD)

## Strategic Notes
- 2-month-old company at $4.5B = extraordinary velocity
- Rao's track record: 2 successful exits ($1.65B combined)
- Bezos backing = significant validation
- Energy efficiency = critical AI infrastructure need
- Analog chip approach = differentiated from digital
- $475M of $1B target = strong investor commitment
- Databricks + Intel experience = deep industry knowledge
- Addresses fundamental AI scaling bottleneck

## Status
Active - Early-stage AI hardware startup
