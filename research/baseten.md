## Funding History
| Round | Date | Amount | Valuation | Lead Investor |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Seed | 2020 | ~$8M | — | Greylock |
| Series A | 2021 | ~$20M | — | Greylock |
| Series B | 2023 | ~$40M | — | Spark Capital |
| Series C | March 2025 | ~$67M | — | IVP |
| Series D | September 2025 | $150M | $2.15B | BOND |
| Series E | January 2026 | $300M | $5B | IVP, CapitalG |
| **Total** | | **~$585M** | | |

## Key Metrics
- **Valuation Growth:** $2.15B to $5B in ~4 months (September 2025 to January 2026)
- **Three capital raises in one year** — unprecedented pace reflecting surging inference demand
- **Key Customers:** Cursor, OpenEvidence, Abridge, Notion, Clay
- **Performance:** Up to 50% faster inference than competing products
- **Infrastructure:** Runs across 10 different infrastructure-as-a-service platforms
- **Key Investors:** CapitalG (Google), NVIDIA ($150M in Series E), IVP, BOND, Greylock, Spark Capital, Conviction, Premji Invest

## Products & Features
- **AI Inference Platform** — Production-grade inference infrastructure for AI applications
- **Operator Fusion** — Combines calculations usually done separately into single computations, saving time
- **Quantization Tools** — Shrinks neural networks to reduce memory requirements
- **Managed Cloud** — Baseten-hosted inference running across 10 IaaS platforms
- **Self-Hosted Option** — Deploy on customer's own infrastructure
- **Model Deployment** — Streamlined ML model deployment from development to production
- **Auto-Scaling** — Dynamic resource allocation based on inference demand

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Together AI, Anyscale, Modal, Replicate, RunPod, AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI

Baseten positions inference as the defining AI infrastructure narrative for 2026, arguing the industry is shifting from training to delivering fast, reliable, and economical inference. Analyst estimates suggest inference will represent ~2/3 of all AI compute by end of 2026, up from ~1/3 in 2023.

## Strategic Notes
- NVIDIA's $150M investment in Series E is a powerful signal — NVIDIA is betting on inference startups as the next infrastructure wave
- CapitalG (Google's growth fund) invested in both Series D and E — Google sees Baseten as complementary, not competitive
- Valuation doubling in 4 months ($2.15B to $5B) reflects explosive demand for inference infrastructure
- Three raises in one year is capital-intensive but justified by the land-grab dynamics of AI infrastructure
- Customer roster (Cursor, Notion, Clay) represents the fastest-growing AI-native companies
- Operator fusion + quantization = genuine technical differentiation, not just GPU reselling
- Risk: AI inference is becoming commoditized; cloud hyperscalers (AWS, Google, Azure) are building competing offerings; capital efficiency matters

## Status
Active — $5B valuation after three raises in one year. The premier independent AI inference platform, backed by both NVIDIA and Google (CapitalG). Positioned at the center of the industry's shift from model training to production inference.
