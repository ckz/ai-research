# Project Prometheus

## Company Overview
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Company Name** | Project Prometheus |
| **Founded** | 2025 |
| **Headquarters** | San Francisco, California, USA |
| **Valuation** | Undisclosed (reported $6.2B initial funding) |
| **Category** | consumer-ai |
| **One-Sentence Description** | Physical-world AI company building systems that learn through robotic experimentation at scale, applying frontier AI models to engineering and manufacturing in computing, aerospace, and automobiles -- co-led by Jeff Bezos and ex-Google X executive Vik Bajaj. |

## Founders & Leadership
- **Jeff Bezos** -- Co-CEO. Founder of Amazon. Most significant operational role since stepping down as Amazon CEO in 2021. Contributing personal capital to the venture.
- **Vik Bajaj** -- Co-CEO. Physicist and chemist. Previously co-founded Verily (Alphabet's life sciences lab), led Google X projects (Taara, Waymo, Wing), and was CEO of Foresite Labs (AI startup incubator). Deep background in moonshot-scale scientific ventures.

## Funding History
| Round | Date | Amount | Valuation | Lead Investor |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Initial (Series A-scale) | Nov 2025 | $6.2B | Undisclosed | Jeff Bezos (led) |
| **Total** | | **$6.2B** | | |

One of the largest initial funding rounds for any startup in history. Bezos contributed personal capital. Other investors not publicly disclosed.

## Key Metrics
- **Employees:** 100-120+ (as of December 2025), rapidly hiring
- **Talent sources:** Poaching from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta
- **Funding scale:** Instantly one of the best-capitalized early-stage AI companies globally
- **Competitive peers by funding:** Dwarfs Periodic Labs ($300M) and Thinking Machines Lab ($2B) in the physical AI space
- **Age:** Less than 1 year old at time of announcement

## Products & Features
- **Physical AI systems** -- AI models that learn from physical experimentation, where robots run thousands of scientific tests simultaneously
- **Materials discovery** -- AI-driven discovery of new materials and manufacturing processes
- **Engineering optimization** -- Automated design and testing cycles for hardware, components, and physical systems
- **Target industries:** Computing hardware, aerospace, automobiles
- **Approach:** Robots run experiments at scale, feed results into ML systems, which generate new hypotheses and test designs in an automated cycle
- **Key differentiator:** Moving AI beyond digital/software domains into physical-world engineering. Unlike LLM companies focused on text/code, Prometheus trains models on real-world experimental data -- a fundamentally different data source and capability.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic (in broader AI), Elon Musk's xAI (Musk labeled Prometheus a "copycat"), Periodic Labs, Thinking Machines Lab, and established industrial R&D labs at companies like Siemens, GE, and Boeing.

Prometheus occupies a unique niche: physical-world AI at startup scale but with Big Tech-level funding. No other startup combines Bezos's operational DNA, $6.2B in capital, and a focus on manufacturing/aerospace AI.

## Strategic Notes
- $6.2B at founding is unprecedented. For context, OpenAI's seed round was $1B (2015), and Anthropic's total funding through 2024 was ~$7.3B accumulated over years. Prometheus starts at near-parity.
- Bezos returning to an operating CEO role signals that he views physical AI as a generational opportunity comparable to Amazon's early days.
- Vik Bajaj's Google X background (Waymo, Wing, Verily) brings expertise in translating moonshot research into operational companies.
- The "physical AI" thesis is that digital AI (LLMs, image generation) is reaching diminishing returns, and the next frontier is AI that interacts with the physical world -- materials, manufacturing, engineering.
- Elon Musk calling Prometheus a "copycat" suggests competitive tension. Musk's xAI, Tesla's manufacturing AI, and SpaceX's aerospace engineering all overlap with Prometheus's stated domains.
- Key insight for startups: Prometheus represents a new category of AI company that cannot be bootstrapped -- physical experimentation requires massive capital from day one (labs, robots, materials, manufacturing equipment). This is not a "two people in a garage" opportunity; it is a capital-moat business.
- The hiring pattern (poaching from OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta) suggests Prometheus is competing for the same elite AI talent pool, potentially accelerating the "brain drain" from incumbent AI labs.
- Risk: No technical details or products have been publicly revealed. The venture could be years from revenue. Bezos acknowledged signs of an "AI industrial bubble" at Italian Tech Week 2025.

## Status
Active - Pre-product. Rapidly hiring and building research infrastructure. Less than 1 year old. No products or technical details publicly announced.
