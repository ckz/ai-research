## Key Metrics
- **Waitlist:** 100,000+ users and 10,000+ businesses prior to public beta launch (June 2025)
- **Product Hunt:** #1 on Product Hunt with 1,000+ upvotes within 24 hours. Featured on Product Hunt Best of 2025 as "Chronicle: Cursor for Slides."
- **Team:** 10 full-time employees (remote across US, India, Australia)
- **Market size:** Presentation software market valued at $6.7B (2025), projected $16.5B (2032)
- **Time to create:** Users report going from rough notes to professional decks in minutes

## Products & Features
- **Widget-based presentations** -- Not traditional slides. Interactive, media-rich widgets with pre-engineered information design and motion built in. More like building an interactive webpage than assembling slides.
- **AI agent collaboration** -- The AI collaborates on messaging, design execution, and narrative flow (not just auto-generating slides from a prompt)
- **Story-first methodology** -- Content structured into narrative sequences with intentional visual hierarchy
- **Keyboard-first workflow** -- Designed for speed and precision
- **Real-time collaboration** -- Shared editing, cursors, team workspaces, contextual comments
- **Charts that animate, visuals that respond** -- Built-in interactivity and motion design
- **Key differentiator:** Chronicle takes a "story-first" approach rather than "template-first." Instead of filling in pre-made slide templates, users build narratives that the AI helps structure and design. The widget system ensures professional design quality without requiring design skills.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, Pitch, Gamma, Beautiful.ai, Canva Presentations, and the now-defunct Tome (shut down April 2025 despite 20M users and $81.6M raised).

Chronicle differentiates with its widget-based architecture (vs. traditional slide decks), AI-agent collaboration model, and story-first approach. The death of Tome (a well-funded competitor) both validates market demand and warns of execution risk.

## Strategic Notes
- Tome's shutdown (April 2025, despite 20M users and $81.6M in funding) is a critical market signal. It shows that "AI generates slides from a prompt" is not enough -- users need quality, control, and design excellence. Chronicle's widget-based, story-first approach addresses this gap.
- 100K waitlist with a 10-person team and $7.5M raised is capital-efficient and demand-validated.
- The "Cursor for X" branding (named after the popular AI coding IDE) is a smart positioning move that immediately communicates the value proposition to the tech community.
- Angel investors from Apple, Google, Slack, Stripe, Superhuman, and Adobe provide design credibility and potential enterprise distribution.
- Key insight for startups: Chronicle demonstrates that even in a market with entrenched incumbents (PowerPoint, Google Slides), there is room for radical UX reinvention when paired with AI capabilities. The widget paradigm (vs. slides) is a genuine architectural bet, not just an AI wrapper.
- Risk: Presentation software has a history of "beautiful tool, hard to scale" -- Prezi, Pitch, and Tome all struggled with enterprise adoption. Chronicle needs to convert waitlist hype into sticky enterprise workflows.

## Status
Active - Public beta launched June 2025 after emerging from stealth. Reportedly targeting ~$20M fundraise. 10-person team scaling.
