- **Workforce Feature:** Enables creation of multi-agent systems using a no-code visual canvas, allowing teams of AI agents to collaborate on complex workflows.
- **Invent (Text-to-Agent):** Users describe what they need in natural language, and the platform automatically generates the AI agent -- billed as the world's first "text-to-agent" generator.
- **Pre-Built Agent Templates:** Ready-made agents for common business workflows.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Microsoft (Copilot Studio), Retell AI, SmythOS, Gooey.AI, Cykel AI, Qeen.ai, CrewAI, LangChain, AutoGen.

Relevance AI differentiates by hitting a "sweet spot" of genuine no-code accessibility combined with sufficient depth for real business workflows. Most competitors either offer deep technical capabilities that require coding or simple no-code tools that lack the power for complex use cases.

**Key Customers:** Qualified, Activision, SafetyCulture, and a range of startups to Fortune 500 enterprises.

## Strategic Notes
- The Australian-founded company has built a meaningful presence in both Sydney and San Francisco, bridging the APAC and US markets.
- 40,000+ agents created in a single month (January 2025) suggests strong product-market fit and viral adoption.
- The "text-to-agent" capability (Invent) is a compelling differentiator -- natural language agent creation dramatically lowers the barrier to AI adoption.
- Bessemer Venture Partners' investment signals strong belief in the no-code agent platform category.
- The AI agent builder market is projected to grow at 45% CAGR over the next five years (BCG).
- By 2026, 40% of applications are expected to include task-specific AI agents, up from <5% in 2025 -- massive TAM expansion ahead.
- Undisclosed valuation makes it harder to assess, but $37M total funding on strong traction suggests the company is still in early growth stage with significant upside.
- Key risk: Microsoft Copilot Studio and similar enterprise platform offerings could commoditize the agent builder category.
- The dual co-CEO structure (Vassilev and Koh) is somewhat unusual but has worked for companies like Atlassian.

## Status
Active -- Series B company with strong traction (40K+ agents/month), growing rapidly in the AI agent builder market with backing from top-tier VCs including Bessemer Venture Partners.
