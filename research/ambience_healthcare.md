## Founders & Leadership
- **Mike Ng** — Co-Founder, President & Chairman (former CEO). MIT Sloan MBA (class of '16). Previously worked in finance. Fractured his back in 2012, was misdiagnosed, and this experience inspired him to improve healthcare systems. Previously co-founded Remedy Health with Buduma.
- **Nikhil Buduma** — Co-Founder & CEO (promoted September 2025, formerly Chief Scientist). MIT MS in Computer Science ('17). Managed a drug discovery lab at age 16. Two-time gold medalist at International Biology Olympiad. Authored "Fundamentals of Deep Learning" (O'Reilly), the first widely adopted modern AI textbook. Co-founded Lean On Me, a national nonprofit for peer support. Named Becker's "Rising Stars: 100 Healthcare Leaders Under 40."
- Ng and Buduma met at MIT in 2014 at the "t=0" entrepreneurship celebration. They first co-founded Remedy Health, where they hired clinicians and implemented AI. Key connection: Google's Jeff Dean invested in Remedy and their friends/housemates went on to start the LLM group at OpenAI.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Nuance (Microsoft/DAX), Suki AI, Abridge, Nabla, DeepScribe, Lifen

Ambience differentiates with its full-stack approach covering documentation + coding + CDI in a single platform, its 100+ specialty support, and direct EHR integration. The a16z backing from seed through Series C and OpenAI Startup Fund involvement signal deep AI-native technical differentiation.

## Strategic Notes
- a16z invested at every stage (seed, Series A, Series C co-lead) — rare sustained conviction from a top-tier VC
- OpenAI Startup Fund as seed investor + Chart Chat powered by OpenAI RFT = deep technical partnership
- Revenue integrity (coding + CDI) is the enterprise selling point — directly impacts hospital bottom line
- Cleveland Clinic, UCSF Health as customers provides unmatched clinical validation
- Founder origin story is deeply personal (Ng's misdiagnosis, Buduma's mentor's cancer death) — drives authentic mission
- CEO transition (Ng to Buduma, September 2025) puts technical co-founder in charge as product complexity increases
- Risk: Nuance (backed by Microsoft) is the 800-lb gorilla in clinical documentation; ambient documentation is becoming commoditized

## Status
Active — Freshly minted unicorn ($1.25B) after $243M Series C. Leading ambient AI platform for healthcare with 40+ major health system customers across 100+ specialties. CEO transition positions technical co-founder to drive next phase of growth.
