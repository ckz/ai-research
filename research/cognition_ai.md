## Key Metrics
- **ARR (Devin standalone):** $1M (Sep 2024) to $73M (Jun 2025) -- 73x growth in 9 months
- **ARR (combined post-Windsurf):** ~$155M (Jul 2025); has since more than doubled
- **Windsurf ARR at acquisition:** $82M, with enterprise ARR doubling quarter-over-quarter
- **Windsurf Users:** 350+ enterprise customers, hundreds of thousands of daily active users
- **Net Burn:** Under $20M across the company's entire history (remarkably capital efficient)
- **Margins:** Large majority of revenue base is positive margin

## Products & Features
- **Devin** -- Autonomous AI software engineer that can plan, write, debug, and deploy code end-to-end. Can work on real-world engineering tasks independently for extended periods.
- **Windsurf IDE** (acquired Jul 2025) -- AI-powered integrated development environment providing human-AI pair programming. Adds IDE-centric workflow to complement Devin's autonomous agent approach.
- **SWE-1.5** -- Frontier-size coding model launched Oct 2025, served via Cerebras for significantly faster inference than competing models.
- **Multi-Agent Assembly Lines** -- Post-acquisition vision for AI-powered QA, DevOps, and low-code application generation -- shifting from individual coding tasks to managing entire development workflows.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Cursor (Anysphere, $29.3B valuation), GitHub Copilot (Microsoft), Lovable ($6.6B), Replit, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Google Gemini Code Assist

Cognition differentiates through full autonomy (Devin handles tasks end-to-end without human supervision) and now offers the full spectrum from IDE (Windsurf) to autonomous agent (Devin).

## Strategic Notes
- The Windsurf acquisition story is one of the most dramatic in recent AI history: Google poached Windsurf's CEO and co-founder in a $2.4B deal, OpenAI's $3B acquisition offer expired, and Cognition swept in to acquire the remaining team and IP.
- Cognition offered buyouts to ~200 Windsurf employees three weeks post-acquisition, signaling the deal was primarily about IP and technology, not headcount.
- The $1M to $73M ARR growth in 9 months (pre-acquisition) is one of the fastest organic revenue ramps in enterprise software history.
- Total net burn under $20M across the company's history is extraordinary given the scale -- this suggests strong unit economics and efficient AI inference costs.
- The coding AI market is the most competitive in all of AI right now. Cursor's $29.3B valuation and aggressive growth creates a fierce two-horse race.

## Status
Active -- One of the highest-valued AI startups globally at $10.2B. Combined Devin + Windsurf platform positions Cognition as a full-stack AI coding company competing for the future of software development.
