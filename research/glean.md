## Competitive Position
Competing with: Microsoft Copilot, Google Vertex AI Search, Elastic, Coveo, Guru, Moveworks, Aisera, OpenAI enterprise products

Glean differentiates through its purpose-built enterprise knowledge graph, breadth of integrations, understanding of organizational permissions and context, and its evolution from search into a full agent platform.

## Strategic Notes
- Glean's trajectory from "enterprise search" to "enterprise AI platform with agents" mirrors the classic platform play: start with a wedge (search), build the knowledge graph, then expand to agents and automation.
- The $100M to $200M ARR in 9 months with pure subscription revenue (no services) is exceptional growth for enterprise software.
- CEO Arvind Jain's Google Search background is directly applicable to building enterprise search, giving Glean deep technical credibility.
- Competition from Microsoft Copilot and Google is the primary strategic risk, as both have native access to enterprise data. Glean's counter is cross-platform neutrality and deeper contextual understanding.
- Named to CNBC Disruptor 50 and Fast Company Top 10 Most Innovative Companies (2025) -- strong brand positioning.
- The 850+ employee count suggests significant investment in enterprise sales and customer success, typical of companies preparing for IPO.

## Status
Active -- One of the fastest-growing enterprise AI companies, with strong IPO potential given $200M ARR, $7.2B valuation, and mature enterprise go-to-market motion.
