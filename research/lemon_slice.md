## Products & Technology

### Lemon Slice-2 Model
- **Parameters**: 20 billion
- **Performance**: 20 FPS on single GPU
- **Capability**: Turn any image into live, conversational video call
- **Architecture**: General-purpose diffusion model

### Delivery Methods
- API access
- Embeddable widget (single line of code integration)

### Voice Integration
- Uses ElevenLabs tech for avatar voice generation

## Technical Approach
Unlike competitors using graphics rendering or GAN-based approaches, Lemon Slice uses:
- Video diffusion transformer (same architecture as Veo3, Sora)
- End-to-end general-purpose model
- No ceiling on quality improvement potential

## YC Partner Endorsement
Jared Friedman (YC): "Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test."

## Competitive Position
Competing with:
- HeyGen
- Synthesia
- D-ID
- Colossyan

### Differentiation
- Real-time generation (vs pre-rendered)
- Diffusion-based approach (vs graphics/GAN)
- Single GPU efficiency
- Any image to avatar capability

## Use Cases
- Real-time video calls
- Interactive customer service
- Live streaming with avatars
- Conversational AI interfaces

## Strategic Notes
- First real-time AI avatar model at scale
- Diffusion approach offers quality ceiling advantage
- YC backing + notable angels
- Early stage with massive potential
- Single GPU efficiency = cost advantage
- API/widget = easy integration path

## Status
Active - Early-stage real-time avatar startup
