## Key Metrics
- **Revenue:** $78.7M (2023); ~$500M+ (2024, up 535% YoY); Q2 2024 alone ~$70M vs $6M in Q2 2023
- **Valuation Growth:** $8.1B to $23B in ~4 months (175% increase)
- **Flagship Chip:** WSE-3 — 5nm process, 1.4 trillion transistors, 900,000+ compute cores (50x more than NVIDIA H100)
- **Key Customers:** IBM, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI (750MW computing deal through 2028, worth $10B+)
- **Investors:** Fidelity, Benchmark Capital, Tiger Global, Valor Equity Partners, Altimeter, Alpha Wave, NVIDIA (indirectly through ecosystem)
- **CFIUS Clearance:** Received March 31, 2025 (resolved G42/UAE investor concerns)

## Products & Features
- **Wafer Scale Engine 3 (WSE-3)** — World's largest chip. 5nm process. 1.4 trillion transistors. 900,000+ AI cores. ~57x the size of a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.
- **CS-3 System** — Complete AI compute system built around the WSE-3
- **AI Inference Services** — Remote computing services for enterprise customers
- **AI Training Infrastructure** — Large-scale model training capabilities
- **Cerebras Cloud** — Managed inference and training cloud services
- **Software Stack** — Cerebras Software Platform for model development and deployment

## Competitive Position
Competing with: NVIDIA (primary), AMD, Intel Habana, Google TPU, Groq, SambaNova, Graphcore

While NVIDIA dominates training and high-throughput data centers, Cerebras is carving out a high-value niche in inference and specialized AI workloads. The wafer-scale approach offers fundamentally different economics for certain workloads — single-chip simplicity vs. multi-GPU cluster complexity.

## Strategic Notes
- OpenAI deal ($10B+, 750MW through 2028) is transformational — validates the wafer-scale approach at the highest level
- Valuation tripled from $8.1B to $23B in 4 months — but secondary market trading around $10B suggests investor caution
- IPO planned for Q2 2026 after CFIUS clearance resolved the G42/UAE investor overhang
- G42 (UAE) accounted for 83% of 2023 revenue and 97% of hardware sales — customer concentration was a major risk, now partially mitigated
- Revenue growth (535% YoY in 2024) demonstrates genuine commercial traction
- Feldman's track record (SeaMicro exit to AMD for $357M) gives confidence in execution
- Risk: NVIDIA's ecosystem dominance, customer concentration (G42), capital-intensive hardware business, secondary market discount to last round valuation

## Status
Active — $23B valuation with IPO targeted for Q2 2026. The only credible wafer-scale alternative to NVIDIA's GPU dominance, validated by a $10B+ OpenAI computing deal. Revenue growing 535% YoY. CFIUS cleared.
