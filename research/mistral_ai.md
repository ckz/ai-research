- **Employees:** 783 (January 2026)
- **Contracts:** Hundreds of millions in signed enterprise contracts
- **Customer Base:** French defense ministry, enterprise customers across Europe and globally
- **Models Released:** Mistral Large 3 (675B params), Ministral 3, Devstral 2, Mistral Vibe CLI

## Products & Features
- **Le Chat** — Consumer-facing AI assistant (competing with ChatGPT)
- **Chat Enterprise** — Enterprise subscription platform for businesses
- **Model Licensing** — API access to Mistral models (Mistral Large, Ministral, Codestral, Pixtral)
- **Mistral Compute** — Planned sovereign AI infrastructure (launching 2026) with 18,000 NVIDIA Grace Blackwell chips, nuclear-powered, Europe's largest independent AI compute
- **Devstral / Mistral Vibe** — Developer-focused coding tools and CLI
- **Open-source models** — Key differentiator from OpenAI/Anthropic; builds trust with European governments

## Competitive Position
Competing with: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Cohere, AI21 Labs

Mistral holds a unique position as Europe's sovereign AI champion. While trailing US rivals in absolute revenue, it is the only non-US company in the top tier of foundation model developers. Its open-source strategy and European data sovereignty positioning give it a regulatory and trust advantage in EU markets.

## Strategic Notes
- Largest seed round in European history ($113M) set the pace for rapid scaling
- ASML's $1.3B investment (11% stake) signals deep hardware-AI integration thesis
- French government is an active customer — rare for a startup this young
- Targeting 1B EUR revenue by end of 2026 would validate European AI independence
- Mistral Compute (nuclear-powered, sovereign infrastructure) could become a strategic moat
- Risk: Current revenue (~$300M ARR) still far below what justifies $14B valuation; needs continued hypergrowth

## Status
Active — Europe's most valuable AI company. Rapidly scaling from foundation models into full-stack enterprise AI and sovereign compute infrastructure. All three founders became France's first AI billionaires in September 2025.
