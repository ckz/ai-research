- **Employees:** 320 (as of late 2025); ~50% are researchers
- **Infrastructure:** 200 MW of power capacity secured; deploying NVIDIA Blackwell GPU clusters across multiple North American data centers
- **GPU Deployment:** Partnership with Hypertec for 36,000 NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 GPUs; up to 100,000 GPUs planned across Europe through 2028
- **Revenue Mix:** API usage (30-40% of revenue) + GPU server rentals (60-70% of revenue)

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Fireworks AI, Anyscale, Modal, Replicate, AWS Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, Lambda Labs, CoreWeave.

Together AI differentiates through its deep open-source commitment (two Stanford professors as co-founders), world-class research team (FlashAttention creator Tri Dao), and hybrid revenue model combining API inference with GPU rentals.

## Strategic Notes
- Valuation more than doubled from $1.25B to $3.3B in approximately one year.
- ~$300M annualized revenue (September 2025) represents strong growth, but the GPU rental business (60-70% of revenue) has lower margins than pure API/SaaS.
- The open-source AI thesis is strengthened by DeepSeek-R1 and Meta's Llama demonstrating that open models can compete with proprietary alternatives.
- Acquisition of Refuel.ai (May 2025) moves the company up the stack into data transformation and structuring.
- European expansion (Sweden, with plans for 100K GPUs across Europe through 2028) positions for sovereign AI demand.
- The founding team is unusually strong for an infrastructure company -- Chris Re, Percy Liang, and Tri Dao are among the most cited ML researchers.
- Key risk: GPU rental is a commoditizing business; API inference margins face pressure from larger cloud providers.
- No IPO plans as of 2025; focused on growth and market expansion.

## Status
Active -- Unicorn-status infrastructure company with $534M total funding, rapidly scaling revenue and GPU infrastructure globally, with a strong open-source thesis backed by world-class ML researchers.
