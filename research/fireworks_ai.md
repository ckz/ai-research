## Key Metrics
- **ARR:** $130M (May 2025, Sacra estimate) -- 20x YoY growth from ~$6.5M (May 2024)
- **Employees:** 166 (January 2026)
- **Tokens Processed:** 10+ trillion tokens per day
- **Customers:** 10,000+
- **Developer Base:** ~23,000 developers (December 2024), up from 12,000 (February 2024)
- **Performance:** Up to 40x faster inference, 8x cost reduction vs. competitors
- **Models Available:** Hundreds of open-source models across text, image, audio, and multimodal

## Products & Features
- **Inference Engine:** Ultra-fast, optimized inference engine delivering industry-leading speed and cost efficiency for production AI workloads.
- **Open-Source Model Hosting:** Access to hundreds of state-of-the-art open-source models (Llama, Mistral, etc.) across text, image, audio, and multimodal formats.
- **Fine-Tuning Service:** Custom model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning and model evaluation.
- **Dedicated Deployments:** GPU-hour billing for dedicated inference clusters with guaranteed capacity.
- **Voice Agents:** Expanded into voice AI capabilities.
- **Multimodal Platform:** Full-stack AI platform supporting text, image, audio, and multimodal workloads.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Together AI, Anyscale, Replicate, Modal, AWS Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, Groq, Lambda Labs.

Fireworks differentiates through its PyTorch pedigree (the founding team built PyTorch at Meta, sustaining 5+ trillion daily inferences), deep inference optimization expertise, and usage-based pricing that aligns with customer success.

**Key Customers:** Uber, Shopify, Genspark, Cursor, Notion, Verizon.

## Strategic Notes
- 20x YoY ARR growth ($6.5M to $130M) is exceptional and validates the inference-first thesis.
- Became a unicorn in just 3 years from founding -- one of the fastest in enterprise AI infrastructure.
- The PyTorch founding team brings unmatched systems engineering credibility -- they built the framework that powers most production AI.
- Usage-based pricing (per-token + GPU-hour) creates revenue growth that scales proportionally with customer AI adoption.
- Plans to grow compute footprint 3-4x over the next year while continuing to drive down cost per token.
- At $4B valuation on ~$130M ARR, the ~31x revenue multiple is more reasonable than many AI startups.
- Key risk: Inference is becoming increasingly commoditized; differentiation through speed/cost must be continuously maintained.
- The expansion from pure inference into fine-tuning, voice agents, and multimodal suggests a platform strategy beyond commodity inference.

## Status
Active -- Unicorn AI inference platform with $4B valuation, experiencing hypergrowth (20x YoY) powered by the team that built PyTorch, expanding from inference into a full-stack AI platform.
