## Company Overview
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Company Name** | Modal Labs, Inc. |
| **Founded** | 2021 |
| **Headquarters** | New York, NY, USA (offices also in San Francisco and Stockholm) |
| **Valuation** | $1.1B (September 2025); targeting ~$2.5B (February 2026 round in progress) |

## Founders & Leadership
- **Erik Bernhardsson** — Co-Founder & CEO. Former engineering leader at Spotify (~employee #30) where he built the first version of Spotify's music recommendation engine (Related Artists, Radio, Discover Weekly). Open-sourced Luigi (workflow engine, 10K+ GitHub stars) and Annoy (approximate nearest neighbors library). CTO at Better.com (ran 300-person tech team). M.Sc. in Physics from KTH Stockholm. Started coding 30+ years ago.
- **Akshat Bubna** — Co-Founder & CTO. Joined as co-founder in 2021 after Bernhardsson began prototyping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

40+ investors including AGI House, Anti Fund, Dimension, General Catalyst, Amplify Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Lux Capital.

## Key Metrics
- **ARR:** ~$50M (February 2026)
- **Valuation trajectory:** Became a unicorn in 2025 (4 years from founding). Targeting 2.3x valuation increase to $2.5B in less than 6 months.
- **Revenue multiple:** ~50x ARR at target valuation
- **Growth:** Rapid — revenue and usage scaling with the AI inference boom
- **Profitable unit economics:** Pay-per-second model with GPU utilization advantages over reserved instances

## Products & Features
- **Serverless GPU compute:** Companies pay only for the seconds a GPU is actually running — no reserved instances sitting idle. Sub-second cold starts mean AI models wake up and perform tasks almost instantly.
- **Custom infrastructure stack:** Built from scratch — custom file system, container runtime, scheduler, container image builder, and more.
- **Python-native SDK:** Standard Python functions transform into scalable, serverless applications with minimal code changes.
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically scales from zero to hundreds of GPUs on demand, then back to zero.
- **Container-based:** Containerized environments defined in code with real-time monitoring and job scheduling.
- **Oracle Cloud GPU access:** Fast, reliable high-performance GPUs from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
- **Multi-use platform:** Supports AI inference, model training, data processing, batch jobs, and web endpoints.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Baseten ($5B valuation, $300M raised), Fireworks AI ($4B valuation, $250M raised), Replicate, RunPod, Together AI, Lambda Labs, AWS/Azure/GCP native GPU services.

**Key differentiator:** Developer experience. While competitors focus on raw GPU access, Modal's serverless abstraction and Python-native SDK make it dramatically easier to go from prototype to production. Sub-second cold starts and pay-per-second pricing eliminate the waste of reserved GPU instances.

## Strategic Notes
- The AI inference market is booming: 2026 is the "year of inference" as the industry shifts from training to deployment. Modal is perfectly positioned for this transition.
- $50M ARR at a ~$2.5B target valuation implies a 50x revenue multiple — aggressive but in line with competitors (Baseten at similar or higher multiples).
- Erik Bernhardsson's background building Spotify's recommendation engine is directly relevant — he understands ML infrastructure at scale from the practitioner's perspective.
- CEO's coy response ("not actively raising") while talking to VCs is classic — the round is likely happening.
- General Catalyst leading (expected) brings connections to infrastructure giants like Stripe and Databricks.
- Risk: The competitive landscape is intensifying rapidly. Baseten ($5B), Fireworks AI ($4B), and cloud providers are all scaling inference infrastructure. Modal needs to maintain its developer experience advantage.
- The custom infrastructure stack (own file system, container runtime, scheduler) is a deep technical moat that is hard to replicate.

## Status
Active — Fast-growing serverless AI compute platform. Unicorn since 2025. In talks for a ~$2.5B valuation round led by General Catalyst as of February 2026. Positioned at the center of the AI inference boom.
