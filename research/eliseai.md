## Competitive Position
Competing with: Funnel Leasing, Hyly.AI, ResMate (in housing); Notable Health, Phreesia, Luma Health (in healthcare)

EliseAI dominates the multifamily housing AI market with unmatched penetration (1 in 12 apartments, 70% of NMHC Top 50). The healthcare expansion leverages the same conversational AI competency in a massive new TAM ($600B+ in US healthcare admin costs).

## Strategic Notes
- Vertical AI mastery: Went deep in housing before expanding to healthcare — classic vertical AI playbook
- $100M+ ARR with $250M Series E gives long runway for healthcare expansion
- 1 in 12 US apartments is extraordinary market penetration for a startup — creates strong network effects and switching costs
- a16z leading the Series E signals belief in the cross-vertical platform thesis
- Healthcare TAM ($600B in admin costs) is orders of magnitude larger than housing
- Founder story is compelling — MIT/Cambridge-educated technical founders who learned the industry from the ground up
- Risk: Healthcare is notoriously difficult to sell into; regulatory complexity much higher than housing

## Status
Active — $2.25B unicorn with $100M+ ARR. Dominant in multifamily housing AI (1 in 12 US apartments) and aggressively expanding into healthcare automation. Doubling headcount with Series E proceeds.
