## Key Metrics
- **Figma installs:** 1.5M+ (making it the #1 Figma extension for developers)
- **Users:** Broad adoption across product, design, and R&D teams
- **Efficiency claims:** Organizations report 50% faster project completion and up to 80% reduction in manual front-end coding
- **Product Hunt:** Featured on Product Hunt's Best of 2025 leaderboard as "Anima - Vibe Coding for Product Teams"
- **Enterprise clients:** Tools like Bolt.new and Replit use Anima for UI code generation from designs

## Products & Features
- **Figma to Code** -- Generate clean React, HTML, or Vue code from Figma designs instantly
- **Website to Code (Clone/Remix)** -- Import any live website and convert it into editable code
- **Prompt to Design** -- Generate high-end UI from natural language prompts, automatically styled to brand guidelines
- **AI Playground** -- Vibe coding environment where non-technical users build apps through conversation
- **Built-in databases** -- Auto-detects when apps need data storage and provisions backends automatically
- **One-click deploy** -- Deploy websites, web apps, and prototypes with shareable live links
- **On-brand vibe coding** -- AI respects brand design systems so team members can build without breaking visual consistency
- **Key differentiator:** Design-awareness. Unlike generic AI coding tools, Anima understands design systems, Figma components, and visual hierarchy. This makes it uniquely suited for product teams where design fidelity matters.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Bolt.new, Replit, v0 (Vercel), Webflow, Framer, Locofy, Builder.io, and emerging vibe-coding platforms.

Anima differentiates by being the bridge between professional design tools (Figma) and production code. While competitors either start from scratch (Bolt, Replit) or are design-only (Figma, Webflow), Anima uniquely spans both worlds.

## Strategic Notes
- IBM's 2026 strategic investment signals enterprise validation for the "vibe coding" approach. IBM's interest likely relates to enabling non-developer employees to build internal tools.
- The "vibe coding" market is projected to grow at ~32.5% CAGR through 2032.
- Anima's 1.5M Figma installs represent a massive distribution wedge -- they are embedded in the workflow of the world's most popular design tool.
- Or Arbel (Yo creator) brings virality/consumer product DNA; Avishay + Michal Cohen bring the developer-designer bridge expertise. Strong founder-market fit.
- Key insight for startups: Anima demonstrates how an existing Figma plugin distribution channel (1.5M installs) can be leveraged as a Trojan horse for a broader AI platform play. Starting with a specific integration (Figma-to-code) and expanding into full vibe coding is a classic "wedge" strategy.
- The fact that Bolt.new and Replit rely on Anima for UI code generation positions Anima as potential infrastructure -- a powerful but potentially risky position (dependency on larger platforms).

## Status
Active - Growing with IBM strategic investment (February 2026). Featured on Product Hunt Best of 2025. Expanding from Figma plugin into full vibe-coding platform for product teams.
