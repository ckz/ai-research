- **Employees:** ~157-209 (varies by source, 2025-2026)
- **Code indexed:** 54+ billion lines
- **Developers using product:** 800,000+
- **Enterprise customers:** Plaid, Uber, Atlassian, and many others
- **Revenue per employee:** ~$240K-$320K

## Products & Features
- **Code Search:** Universal code search across massive codebases. Mission-critical infrastructure for enterprises navigating millions of lines of code. Supports self-hosted and air-gapped deployments.
- **Cody (AI Assistant):** Enterprise AI code assistant powered by deep codebase understanding via Sourcegraph's search and code graph technology. Leads with self-hosted and air-gapped deployment. Enterprise pricing at $59/user/month. Free and Pro tiers discontinued July 2025.
- **Amp (AI Coding Agent):** Launched 2025, then spun out as independent company (Amp Inc.) in late 2025. Frontier AI coding agent for code generation, documentation, testing, and refactoring. Credit-based pricing model. Available via web, CLI, and IDE extensions. Claims profitability. Ad-supported free tier.
- **Enterprise security:** Self-hosted, air-gapped, and private deployment options critical for regulated industries.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cognition (Devin), Replit, Tabnine, Amazon Q Developer, JetBrains AI.

**Key differentiator:** Deep code search and codebase understanding. While competitors offer generic AI completion, Sourcegraph's code graph gives its AI tools unmatched context across massive enterprise codebases. The Amp spin-out allows both code search and AI agents to move independently.

## Strategic Notes
- The Amp spin-out (late 2025) is a pivotal strategic move: Sourcegraph (code search) and Amp (frontier AI agent) have fundamentally different distribution engines and target audiences. Separating them allows each to move faster.
- $50M revenue on a $2.625B valuation (from 2021) suggests the company may be seeking a re-pricing — either up or down — depending on growth trajectory.
- 54B lines indexed and 800K developers is a massive moat for enterprise code intelligence.
- The AI coding agent market is extremely competitive: Cognition ($500M raise), Cursor, Replit, and others have collectively raised nearly $2B in recent months.
- Amp's ad-supported model is unconventional for developer tools — signals willingness to experiment with distribution.
- IPO considerations have been discussed publicly, suggesting the company is eyeing public markets as a next step.

## Status
Active — Mature enterprise code intelligence platform undergoing strategic split. Sourcegraph (code search) continues under new CEO Dan Adler. Amp (AI coding agent) spun out as independent company led by co-founders Quinn Slack and Beyang Liu.
