## Key Metrics
- **Users:** 286K+ on platform
- **Employees:** ~30 (mid-2025), distributed between San Francisco and London
- **Viral moment:** Twitter Personality app gained 1M users in 4 days
- **Enterprise customers:** Instacart, Uber, Runway
- **Hiring:** Actively recruiting across operations, marketing, engineering, and design

## Products & Features
- **Natural language IDE:** Web-hosted IDE for building AI agents using a programming language that merges plain English with loops, conditionals, and function calling.
- **No-code/low-code agent building:** Domain experts (not just engineers) can create sophisticated AI workflows.
- **Triggers & Actions:** Launched April 2025 with 2,000+ integrations for automated workflows.
- **Sauna (2025):** AI workspace for professionals, described as "Cursor for Knowledge Work." Connects to Gmail, Calendar, Slack, and thousands more tools. Learns user context, drafts documents, researches across web and internal knowledge.
- **Full-stack AI OS:** Positions itself as a complete operating system for AI development.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Flowise, n8n AI, Zapier AI, no-code AI workflow tools.

**Key differentiator:** Natural language as the programming interface — enabling domain experts (not just developers) to build production AI agents. Strong viral product-led growth demonstrated by the Twitter Personality app.

## Strategic Notes
- One of the largest YC seed rounds ever signals strong investor conviction.
- Pivot journey is notable: Started as an IDE, launched Triggers & Actions, then evolved toward Sauna (AI workspace) after observing users building workflows but not returning. Main launch planned Q1 2026.
- The bet is that AI development will be democratized beyond engineers — natural language becomes the programming language.
- Rapid angel interest (Paul Graham, Webflow founder, Front founder) suggests strong founder reputation in the ecosystem.
- Risk: The product is still evolving toward product-market fit. The pivot from IDE to workspace to assistant suggests the core value proposition is still being refined.

## Status
Active — Well-funded AI agent platform in rapid product iteration mode. Pivoting from pure IDE toward AI workspace (Sauna), targeting Q1 2026 for main launch.
