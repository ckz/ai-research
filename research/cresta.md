## Competitive Position
Competing with: Medallia, Gong, Outreach, Balto Software, NICE CXone, Five9, Genesys, Google CCAI

Cresta differentiates with its human+AI philosophy — augmenting human agents rather than replacing them. The addition of the Agent Operations Center creates a unified management layer for hybrid workforces, a unique positioning as contact centers adopt both human and AI agents.

## Strategic Notes
- Sebastian Thrun co-founder gives unmatched AI credibility and Silicon Valley access
- CEO transition (Enam to Ping Wu) brought deep Google CCAI expertise — critical for enterprise credibility
- Human+AI approach is pragmatic — contact centers are not ready for full automation, hybrid management is the real need
- Brinks Home case study (73% transfer reduction) is powerful sales proof point
- New engineering hubs in Romania and India signal cost-efficient scaling
- Series D investors (WiL, QIA, Accenture, LG, Qualcomm, Workday) are strategic enterprise partners
- Risk: Contact center AI is intensely competitive; Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all have CCAI products

## Status
Active — $1.6B+ unicorn rapidly expanding from real-time coaching into full AI-human hybrid contact center management. Series D ($125M, November 2024) fueling R&D and global expansion.
