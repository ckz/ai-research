## Key Lessons from Harvey

1. **Founder-market fit**: Build in an industry you've worked in
2. **Test with real experts**: 86/100 validation was cheapest, fastest proof
3. **Process expertise is moat**: Step-by-step knowledge doesn't exist online
4. **Prestige-first GTM**: Landing hardest customers creates trust cascade
5. **Domain-specific evaluation**: Generic benchmarks don't capture real performance
6. **Build for where models are going**: Tackle complex problems
7. **Do things that don't scale**: Hyper-personalized demos, embedded engineers
8. **Expand and collapse**: Build specialized agents, then unify UI
9. **Security is table stakes**: SOC 2, zero-training from day one
10. **Align incentives**: Revenue-split models vs efficiency selling
