## Key Metrics
- **Developers:** 1,000,000+ users
- **IDE installations:** 10M+ across VS Code and JetBrains
- **Employees:** ~46 (mid-2024), reduced after Feb 2025 restructuring (18% layoffs)
- **Patents:** Proprietary models trained on permissively licensed code only
- **Industry recognition:** Gartner Magic Quadrant Visionary (Sept 2025), InfoWorld Technology of the Year 2025, AI Tech Awards "Best Innovation in AI Coding" 2025

## Products & Features
- **Privacy-first architecture:** "No-train, no-retain" policy — customer code is never used to train models, inference context is ephemeral and deleted after response.
- **Deployment flexibility:** Cloud SaaS, single-tenant SaaS, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), on-premises, and fully air-gapped deployment options.
- **Multi-model support:** Proprietary Tabnine models plus Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.3 70b. Enterprise users can bring their own fine-tuned models.
- **Code Review Agent:** Won "Best Innovation in AI Coding" at 2025 AI Tech Awards.
- **AI-powered agents:** Plan, code, test, document, and review software using secure AI agents.
- **IP indemnification:** Enterprise plan includes intellectual property protection.
- **Dell partnership:** Turnkey GPU-accelerated air-gapped deployment showcased at NVIDIA GTC 2025 for finance, defense, and healthcare.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Amazon Q Developer, Sourcegraph Cody, JetBrains AI, Codeium.

**Key differentiator:** Privacy and compliance are the headline — Tabnine is the AI code assistant that regulated industries (banking, healthcare, defense, government) can actually get approved by legal and compliance teams. Air-gapped deployment, no data retention, and IP-clean training data set it apart.

## Strategic Notes
- The privacy-first positioning is a genuine moat in regulated industries where competitors cannot operate. If your legal team needs to approve an AI coding tool for a bank or defense contractor, Tabnine is likely the only option.
- Feb 2025 layoffs (18% of workforce) signal a pivot to focus on enterprise revenue over developer community growth. The free Basic tier was discontinued in April 2025.
- The Dell partnership for air-gapped GPU deployment is a smart channel play — it makes Tabnine deployable in the most sensitive environments with minimal friction.
- Gartner Magic Quadrant "Visionary" recognition (Sept 2025) provides enterprise credibility that smaller competitors lack.
- Risk: GitHub Copilot dominates the general market. Tabnine's survival depends on the regulated enterprise niche remaining large enough and underserved enough to sustain growth.
- Funding discrepancy ($55M vs. $102M reported by different sources) may reflect inclusion of grants, convertible notes, or undisclosed rounds.

## Status
Active — Privacy-first AI code assistant pivoting to enterprise focus. Restructured in early 2025, doubling down on regulated industries and air-gapped deployments. Strong industry recognition from Gartner and InfoWorld.
