## Products & Features
- **Multi-agent architecture:** Core insight is that a team of specialized agents beats one generalist assistant — each agent is narrow, specific, and pulls from exact data sources needed.
- **Multi-model orchestration:** Integrates Claude, GPT-4, Gemini and others. Different queries route to different models based on their strengths (reasoning, speed, multimodal).
- **Enterprise data connectors:** Connects to internal company infrastructure (Slack, Notion, Google Drive, CRMs, databases) to give agents real context.
- **No-code deployment:** Agents can be deployed in minutes without coding.
- **Customizable AI assistants:** Teams build domain-specific agents for their workflows rather than using one generic chatbot.

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Glean, You Technologies, Cohere, Microsoft Copilot, Google Workspace AI, custom internal AI tools. Dust ranks 32nd among 776 active competitors and 11th in total funding among competitors.

**Key differentiator:** Multi-agent specialization approach vs. single-assistant competitors. 70% weekly adoption rates suggest genuine product-market fit beyond pilot purgatory.

## Strategic Notes
- Capital efficiency is a standout — $7.3M ARR with only $21.5M raised and 66 employees signals strong unit economics.
- Sequoia doubled down, leading both seed and Series A, which is a strong signal.
- French headquarters positions Dust in Europe's growing AI ecosystem while maintaining Silicon Valley investor relationships.
- The 70% weekly usage rate is the real moat — most enterprise AI tools see adoption crater after pilots.
- Exit path: Strategic acquisition by a platform player wanting an AI agent layer, or continued growth toward IPO with 3x growth sustained over 3-4 years.
- Enterprise customers include Clay, Qonto, Doctolib, and Alan.

## Status
Active — Fast-growing enterprise AI agent platform with strong product-market fit and capital efficiency. Positioned as a leading European AI startup backed by Sequoia Capital.
