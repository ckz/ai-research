## Key Metrics
- **Conversations processed:** Hundreds of millions across 50+ financial institutions in 18 months
- **Clients:** 50+ BFSI institutions including RBL Bank, AU Small Finance Bank, Axis Finance, Fibe, IDFC FIRST Bank, SBI Life Insurance, Piramal Finance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Motilal Oswal, Groww
- **Target:** 300+ BFSI clients and billions of monthly interactions

## Products & Features
- **Voice AI Agents** -- Autonomous voice agents for customer service, collections, KYC, onboarding, and cross-selling across BFSI
- **Multilingual support** -- Built for Indian languages and dialects, addressing a market where most customers prefer regional languages
- **Compliance-first architecture** -- Regulatory controls embedded at the model layer for RBI/IRDAI compliance
- **Real-time speech recognition** -- Domain-specific NLU tuned for financial services terminology
- **Conversation auditing** -- Comprehensive audit tools for compliance teams to review AI-handled conversations
- **Key differentiator:** India-specific BFSI compliance + multilingual voice AI is a narrow wedge that global competitors (Uniphore, Five9) cannot easily replicate

## Competitive Position
Competing with: Uniphore, Mihup, Observe.AI, Yellow.ai, Haptik (Jio), and global voice AI platforms expanding into India.

GreyLabs differentiates with deep BFSI specialization, Indian language coverage, and regulatory compliance baked into the platform rather than bolted on.

## Strategic Notes
- The Indian BFSI market is massive (1.4B population, rapid financial inclusion, digital payments explosion) and underserved by global AI voice providers.
- Founding team's prior exit (Cogno AI to Exotel) demonstrates domain expertise and execution capability in the same vertical.
- Regulatory moat: India's financial regulators (RBI, IRDAI, SEBI) have specific rules around recorded conversations, disclosure, and customer communication that create barriers for generic AI platforms.
- Key insight for startups: GreyLabs illustrates the "vertical AI in emerging markets" playbook -- deep domain expertise + local language support + regulatory compliance creates defensibility that horizontal AI platforms struggle to match.

## Status
Active - Rapidly scaling post-Series A. Expanding team and geographic footprint across India. Targeting 300+ BFSI clients.
